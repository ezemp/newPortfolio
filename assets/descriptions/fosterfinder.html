            <p> For our second group project the group I was with decided to try
                and make a site to help facillitate the fostering process for pets.
                To achieve this goal we were going to use several seperate api calls.
                One api was to find out what was available for adoption at specific shelters,
                the next api was to take that information, including the address, and  populate it 
                on a map.  We hit a major snag in this area due to the way our first api
                returned information.  XML format was something we were not familiar with
                so we had to quickly learn how to translate XML into json. This project
                was also my first forray into building an auth system. </p>

            <img src = "../images/nomadPic.jpg" class = "mePicture">
            <p>Nomad Travlr was the first group project assinged in our coding bootcamp.  What our group was trying to do was create a site that
            would allow people to plan out a trip by searching for a destination and then allowing the users to search for
            venues or attractions they may wish to see during a vacation.  They would then be able to add those cities and venues
            to a favorites list that is saved to the users account for later viewing. We would like to add the ability to look at
            air fares to their choesn destination as well as have reviews available when looking up attractions. My main contributions in this project is looking into potential
            apis, building the database, linking the database to user accounts, and worked on the styling on the login page.</p>
